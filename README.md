## Hey there! 👋


Thanks for your interest in joining the Thrive Dev team. In order for us to better evaluate your experience, skills, and fit for our team, we'd like you complete a small coding challenge.



## The challenge

You are building out a payment API for an e-commerce platform. You're working on the user story "As a user, I can submit my order and payment details to the system, in order to complete my purchase".


## The acceptance criteria are:

Functional requirements

- Provide the order items including itemId, quantity

- Provide payment details: cardNo, expiryDate, CVC no

- Non-functional requirements

- API request must be validated (*no need to validate payment details for this challenge!*)

- ItemIds exist

- Items are in stock

- Calls to API must be idempotent

You *must* use:

- Typescript in node.js OR a statically-typed language

- REST or graphQL as the API layer

- a persistence layer

- The rest of your implementation is down to you (libraries, frameworks, etc)- 

**For your code submission, it's preferred that you send us a link to a GIT repository showing your personal commits, rather than a zip file, but a ZIP is acceptable. Your submission should include:**

- the code

- a complete README on how to run the code, including any environment variables

- if you use an RDBM persistence layer , provide the SQL schema as a SQL file


Thank you! Happy coding :)
