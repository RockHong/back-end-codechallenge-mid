How to Run
========
## Start the server
- In a terminal, go to root directory of this project.
- Type `./gradlew bootRun`

## Test the REST API
### Get cart
    curl localhost:8001/cart/1

### Add/update item to/in cart
Add an item to the cart.

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"productId": 2, "quantity": "3"}' \
        localhost:8001/cart/1/items

Update the quantity of the item in the cart (using POST).

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"productId": 2, "quantity": "6"}' \
        localhost:8001/cart/1/items

Update the quantity of the item in the cart (using PUT).

    curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"quantity": "66"}' \
        localhost:8001/cart/1/items/1

### Empty cart
    curl -X DELETE -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8001/cart/1/items

### Place order
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"paymentMethod": {"cardNumber": "123", "type":"CREDIT_CARD"}}' \
        localhost:8001/cart/1/placeOrder

### Add non-existed product
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"productId": 22222, "quantity": "3"}' \
        localhost:8001/cart/1/items

## Connect the H2 database
In a browser, open http://localhost:8001/h2-console .
Check the `applicaton.properties` file for the credentials.

## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹


Thanks for your interest in joining the Thrive Dev team. In order for us to better evaluate your experience, skills, and fit for our team, we'd like you complete a small coding challenge designed to test the abilities of mid-senior level back-end engineers


## The challenge

You are building out an ordering API for an e-commerce platform. You're working on the user story "As a user, I can submit my order and payment details to the system, in order to complete my purchase.""

## The acceptance criteria are:
### Functional requirements

- Create a cart, add items, remove items. Total price is retained at current prices of the items, not the price at the time of being added to the cart. 
    - Items added to cart must exist
    - Items added to cart must be in stock

- Place an order by providing payment details: cardNo, expiryDate, CVC no, and cartNumber. 
    - Items in cart must be in stock at time of order
    - Cart instance should be converted to an order
        - Order should now have itemized static prices equal to price at time of order
        - Total reflects the cost of items at time of order
    - Returning order number and order status, and total charge. 

### Non-functional requirements

- **API calls must be idempotent**
- You *must*:
    - use Typescript in node.js OR a statically-typed language of your choice
    - use a REST or graphQL (preferred) as the API layer
    - a persistence layer
- The rest of your implementation is down to you (libraries, frameworks, etc)

## Guidance

- Implement best practices of API design
- Consider concurrency
- Read all the requirements. Assessment will be made based on number of requirements satisfied

**For your code submission, it's preferred that you send us a link to a GIT repository showing your personal commits, rather than a zip file, but a ZIP is acceptable. Your submission should include:**

- the code

- a complete README on how to run the code, including any environment variables

- if you use an RDBM persistence layer , provide the SQL schema as a SQL file


Thank you! Happy coding :)
